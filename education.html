  <div class="textdiv"><h1>Education</h1><p>My education is not very extensive at this present moment. I have been a student for awhile now but I have not graduated as of yet. I believe my planned graduation date is December of 2023 and I hope that is correct. While my formal education may be lacking I do have a high school diploma and plenty of hands on work experience. I've worked at many different places and for a variety of industries. I feel that this more than makes up for my lack of a college diploma. (Though I still plan to get one, do not worry) 
I have attended a variety of schools growing up, my family has a background in the military so we moved a lot when I was younger. Due to this, I don't have any favorite subjects or teachers as they often changed too much from place to place. My preferred learning style is observing or doing, it is hard for me to follow along with lectures because I do not retain information by hearing it. (This has been especially hard to navigate since my being in college, so many classes are primarily lecture based) Even with that being said I work hard to overcome that setback because I want to be successful in my classes and with my studies. I think work ethic will always beat being naturally academically gifted because even if you're given a talent it will mean nothing if you do nothing to refine and hone that talent.</p></div>
