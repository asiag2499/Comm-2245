  <div class="textdiv"><h1>Home</h1>Hello, my name is Asia and I am originally from Georgia but I moved to Albuquerque this past April. I am not sure what year student I am since I've come and gone so many times. My current major is Communications with a minor in sociology though I'm not sure if I will stick with it. (I have change majors three times) I am 23 years old and I have a dog and a cat who keep me on my toes with their antics and shenanigans. There is never a dull day with them around that's for sure! I enjoy writing and reading in my spare time along with dancing and singing. I have always been creative even as a young child so it has been exciting to pursue these talents of mine further as I age. As of late I have taken up music production. I am taking this course because I would love to start a blog detailing my adventures in music production and the trials and learning curves I have had to overcome since starting, the journey is going to be long but rewarding! I chose this photo because it represents the new beginning I have been attained since moving to Albuquerque and how far I have come. I hope to come even further in the future and to have some of my goals realized. Starting over in a new place is scary and it makes me nervous when I think about it! However, I do not plan to let my nervousness get the best of me. Please enjoy my website.</div>
